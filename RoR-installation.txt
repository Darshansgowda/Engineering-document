ruby -v

Working with Gems
echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc

gem install bundler

gem env home

Installing Rails
gem install rails -v 5.2.0

Note: If you would like to install a different version of Rails, you can list the valid versions of Rails by doing a search, which will output a long list of possible versions. We can then install a specific version, such as 4.2.7:

gem search '^rails$' --all

gem install rails -v 4.2.7

If you would like to install the latest version of Rails, run the command without a version specified:
gem install rails
rbenv rehash
rails -v
Updating rbenv
cd ~/.rbenv
git pull
Uninstalling Ruby versions
rbenv uninstall <specific version>
Uninstalling rbenv
nano ~/.bashrc
Find and remove the following two lines from the file:
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(rbenv init -)"
Then remove rbenv and all installed Ruby versions with this command:
rm -rf `rbenv root`
